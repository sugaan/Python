In a typical lunch outing with a group of colleagues, itâ€™s often debated who will cover the lunch bill. One fun and fair way to resolve this is by randomly picking a name from the group, letting chance decide who pays. This script accomplishes exactly that by simulating the process of selecting a business card from a list of names. Each name represents a person at the lunch, and the randomly chosen person will be the one to pay.
